Besides what other commenters wrote here, you should rethink how you serve the Angular project if this is supposed to be used in production. ng serve uses a dev server that is not really good for production use, so you should probably build your Angular project and serve it with something like Nginx or Apache. There are Docker containers for those too and you can use multistage builds to first build the Angular project and then copy your built site over to the actual server container.
