A modern AIM-9X for example can be given targeting data from the planes radar or helmet mounted sight prior to launch and can track a target up to 90° to the sides (of boresight), allowing pilots to shoot at targets without having to point their own planes nose even close to it.

and thats just what unclassified, official data says. Actual capability is most probably higher than that still.

Classified information is normally very specific. Entire capabilities normally wouldn't be classified. Instead, individual numbers like the total engine burn time, fuse detonation time, or turning radius might be classified.

You can generally guess the classified parameters of a system. If it's an engine, the thrust vectoring angle might be classified, or maybe the thrust. Notice for the F35's F135 engine, the Pratt & Whitney product page only states that it provides "more than 40000 lbs" of thrust. I'd assume the exact number is classified. On any communications systems, I'd assume the range and frequency are classified, at the very least. Basically, look at any classified system. Any and all of the specific operating parameters are probably classified.

Edit: The F135 engine is used on the F35, not the F22.

There's a similar system for spy satellites. The exact model of satellite in question won't be identified, but based on what obit it's going to and which launch vehicle is used, you can make an educated guess.

For instance, if something is going into near polar orbit (ie. Launching from Vandenberg) and is riding a Delta IV Heavy, you can make the educated guess that it's probably around 20 tons.

Well, the specific thrust might actually be significantly higher than 40000. Maybe it's 60000. Maybe that specific thrust is indicative of a minimum takeoff distance, which would allow you to determine whether a specific model aircraft with weight x would be able to take off from a given runway of length y at a given airbase. Maybe it would allow you to analyze which weapons said aircraft could possibly be carrying based on maximum allowable weight, maybe how much fuel.

Design engagement parameters for visual range engagements.

F-22's weight isn't classified (it's 43,430 lbs), unloaded 65k lbs gross, with a MTOW of 83.5 lbs. It's listed thrust to weight ratio is 1.09 (1.25 in a combat configuration), but two F119 power plants providing 80,000 lbs of thrust gives its real thrust to weight ratio of at least 1.30.

This, along with wing loading, very closely define its maneuverability and acceleration abilities across the entire flight profile.

So if you're an adversary, you can define and train well in advance "We only engage with this target when various parameters are in our favor, and we disengage and run away when they are not."

Presumably both sides do this, so whoever has the most accurate data can make the most accurate decisions about when to engage or not, and whoever doesn't will make faulty decisions leading to tactical losses at the beginning of the engagement.

The range would be directly related to the power of the system, which would also be classified.

Discoverability isn't a factor when determining the classification level of a piece of information. For example, the operating frequency of a radar is easily discoverable. Get an antenna, sit next to a radar test range, and collect leakage radiation. Run a Fourier Transform on the collected data and your operating frequency will probably be 20-40 dB above everything else you collected.

Most of what is classified is due to how it is collected, not the material itself. Obviously when you’re talking specifically about capabilities that’s different.

A few possible reasons. First, it would make doc control's job a living hell. Every individual classified document is actively tracked and controlled, whether physical or digital. This is a painstaking process. The more broadly you classify something, the harder it becomes to maintain secrecy and even just communicate about the thing. Second, when you encounter something classified, you generally take extreme precautions to remind yourself it's classified. You have to be very deliberate and conscious when conversation steers near that info. The more of that there is, the heavier the burden you place on your employees. People don't like having criminal penalties hanging over every word. Third, it might misdirect enemies. If they think the engine is ~40k lbs and design a weapons system to counter it, but it's actually 60000 lbs, you just made them invest money in a worthless system. Fourth, you'd be creating all of these issues to protect unimportant information. An engineer could probably look at the plane, guess the approx weight and, given the plane's top speed from videos or some other source, calculate the approximate thrust of the engine to some degree of precision.

I think that statement is still relatively valid, but not due to classification. A huge problem with research is viability. We could make a room temperature superconductors, but it may not be commercially viable for another 15 years. The commercial/consumer environment is quite rough on technology. Neither consumers nor companies want to pay for upkeep. They're going to cut corners and costs. They want a robust, mature product. If you try to sell them a brand new cutting edge quantum computer, but you can't move or touch it while you're using it because you haven't quite worked out the memory isolation yet, it won't sell. So while some things are possible today , they won't be commercially viable for 10-20 years.

Edit: a great example of this is battery technology. New battery tech is published every year, but we still use shitty disposable chemical batteries. Look up nanowire batteries. In 2018, there were tons of pop-sci articles claiming they'd replace lithium. Guess what, they're expensive to manufacture. Therefore, no gold nanowire batteries yet.

Classified information is very limited and specific. It's done this way so engineers can work on things without security clearance. In a case like this, it might be classified at what range this is effective.

For a good example, I worked on simulating nuclear weapons and their results on the battlefield. They gave us the models and enough information to simulate a nuclear weapon, but there was a set of co-efficents that were used in the model. The co-efficents were from real test data, but told they were really old declassified data (pre-1960, but didn't tell us the test or date). The real numbers would give very different results (like yeilds 1000x what we were seeing, but that's just a guess based on what's publicly available).

The other issue is if you use classified information to create anything, that thing is now classified too. Which means classifying too much can lead to mountains of classified paperwork that gives an enemy no useful information, but creates a lot of work around handling/tracking that data.

Missiles burn off their fuel pretty fast and then coast under momentum, every adjustment reducing their died and thus range. Early Sidewinders only burned for 2.2 seconds, and modern versions don't burn much longer. The AIM-120, with a range of over 100 miles, burns only a little over ten seconds.

So, the early design of the F-4 Phantom fighter jet (vietnam-era) had no guns, b/c designers assumed superior missile technology would allow the planes to just "stand off" and fire at range. Well what happens when you miss? The pilots raised hell and guns were quickly added back into the design. The F-4 ended up seeing a lot of dogfighting (even though it was not originally designed for that).

A $2 arm chip in a Raspberry Pi could fail and the outcome is that somebody has to go buy another one. A $2 arm chip failing in this means the wrong person could die. If a pilot ends up in a fight with 2 of these missiles, 2 of them better be able to successfully leave the rails, guide on the target, fuse in the right place at the right time, and inflict damage. Any one of those failing reduces the chance the pilot comes home alive. That's why it costs a few hundred grand per missile - for guaranteed success every time the button gets pushed.

Bought the missile yesterday? It needs to work. Bought the missile 10 years ago and it's sat in the ammo depot until finally getting strapped to an airplane? It needs to work. The airplane the missile got strapped to got thoroughly soaked because it launched off of a carrier in the middle of a tropical storm? It better work. Missile got stored in the desert in a facility that measures 50+ degrees C on a regular basis, and got sandblasted on takeoff flying off of a desert strip? It better work. Missile is being fired from airplane flying out of Alaska at -40? It better work.

The devils advocate in me would say that the items built need to be held to the absolute HIGHEST possible standard. A $4 arm chip could handle it, but what if there is a slight error that creates a RAM leak (? I forget what its called). You over-compensate with better and better tech to make sure that it works every time without fail. Say it can be done with 1GB RAM, you want to double it to be safe, but then you double THAT to be extra safe.

If with 1GB RAM the chance of a missle going haywire and missing its target is 0.01%, then you've just unnecessarily risked the lives of not only civilians, but on the pilot (who is worth a lot more than 1GB of RAM) who, once he misses his target, could be gunned down by that enemy target he missed.

Another argument I'd make is that you basically have to pretend every piece of high end military equipment is "custom made". R&D constantly has to reiterate new technologies to outperform competing super-powers technology. Sure, we could build an armada of cargo-ships outfitted with $500 SCUD missiles to invade iraq with, but if they have anything even remotely similar to Israels "Iron Dome" technology, we would be ineffective.

"Iron Dome" technology ain't cheap, either, so building a brand-new missile that can out-maneuver and/or sneak past the "Iron Dome" tech is important, and worth every penny, if you can effortlessly take out specific targets against an enemy with that tech. (Not that we would, its likely that the US helped Israel design and maintain that tech)

Old missiles would only track and fly towards a heat source, so a sharp turn while the missile is some ways away will leave it flying near perpendicular to you and tracking the back of your plane, making it extremely easy for the missile to miss. Other methods of evasion would be to fly in such a way that you put your self between the missile and the sun, which puts out much more ir energy and the missile will switch target to the sun. Alternatively, the missile only has seconds of fuel so if you have an altitude advantage over the missile when it's launched it will be more difficult for it to buildup speed and will simply fall out of the sky if it doesn't have enough speed to keep flying. Modern missiles can negate the first 2 evasion methods by calculating intercept paths and being able to distinguish between the ir signature of the plane engine and other sources

You pop flares to try and fool it. If that doesn't work you try and out fly it. This is done by flying in a pattern that makes the missile turn a lot, losing a lot of kinetic energy. Hoping that the missile runs out of energy before it gets to you.

They had limited steering ability and only worked when shot at a plane from behind it (called "rear-aspect"), and even then weren't that reliable.

Even so missiles like the AIM-9 Sidewinder were groundbreaking when they were released and represented a significant strategic advantage over non-guided missiles.

Unfortunately for the US, one missile shot at a Chinese jet failed to detonate and got stuck in the fusalage. They were able to land the jet and sent the missile to Russia who reverse engineered and reproduced the design.

One thing usually gotten wrong in movies is that most missiles, including many if not all heatseekers, have a rocket engine that burns only for the first few seconds of flight. Hence, kinetic energy of the missile starts getting lower once the engine shuts off, and the missile is less maneuverable and therefore has a lower chance of hitting a maneuvering target at longer range.

Therefore, maximum range and maximum effective range can be quite different. Some missiles do have sustainer rocket engines to maintain propulsion over a longer period of flight but I can't think of any heatseeker missiles with sustainerers.

There are a couple of long range heatseeking missiles that are designed for use against ballistic missiles, but otherwise heatseekers tend to be short range missiles (where a sustaining rocket would just add weight and reduce maneuverability).

P.S: And "the first few seconds of flight" is still typically 25-50% of the missiles total flight time to target.

[–]dvinpayne [score hidden] 2 hours ago 
I still haven't seen an explanation of the "heat-seeking" logic of the problem that I really like so here's my attempt.

Starting with the old IR (infrared) missiles it's fairly simple. If you take an IR camera and point it at the back of an engine it there will be a very obvious hot spot. (https://youtu.be/2C6ZcqeIvjw). Because the difference in temperature between the engine/its exhaust and the environment is so large its easy to identify that as a targeting point. That is why the earliest missiles could only be fired from directly behind the target where they could see directly into the engine where the largest temperature difference would be. Then versions were made where they could detect the difference using just the exhaust instead of the engine core which greatly expanded the angles they were usable from, but still weren't effective if the exhaust was out of line of sight.

Flares exploit the simplistic nature of this temperature difference logic by creating a larger temperature difference so the missile tracks them instead. To combat this engineers changed what the IR camera is looking at essentially. With better sensor technology the missiles no longer look at just what is the brightest thing in the field of view, instead they look for airframe heating. As a plane flys it encounters air resistance which is essentially friction between the plane and the air. That friction heats up the plane (this is part of why the fastes aircraft require special materials). The temperature difference between the friction heated aircraft and the rest of the sky is measurable but still fairly small. There can certainly be other things in the missiles field of view that have a larger temperature difference, so the missile has to know what it's looking for. To solve this these missiles have a form of image recognition built into their computers so that they can recognize aircraft shaped temperature differences and target those specifically. That makes it much harder for flares to fool these missiles while also allowing the guidance computers do a better job figuring out where the target is going so the missile can get there first.

Others have covered this in other ways but "Do they work exactly like in the movies?" No. If a missile goes past a target will it turn around to try again? No, at that point it has been defeated. Will a missile chase for over a minute while right behind a plane very slowly getting closer? No, most missiles travel far faster than the aircraft they're targeting and aren't going to slow down to give you time to think. Can you out maneuver a missile? Yes... But it's very very rare and will usually leave you in a very vulnerable position to the next missile. There are methods to reliably defeat missiles, but that isn't one usually.

[–]prometheus2508 [score hidden] 54 minutes ago 
I'll provide an addendum.

"Heat" can be broken into three bands. Short, Medium and Long wave infrared. The hotter the object, the more shorter wave, higher energy per photon, infrared will be emitted as per the blackbody radiation. Things in the high hundreds and thousands of degrees F are short wave emitters, mid hundreds are medium wave, and things around 150-250 are long wave emitters.

This is important because that high energy short wave is a lot easier to detect, and early heat sensors were predominately built around this. On jets, the only thing this hot are the afterburner plume or the turbine blades up the engine. This put constraints on how and when infrared missiles could be employed - when the target was in an afterburning state or when the shooter was "looking up the tailpipe" of the target.

Later, sensors that could detect and prosecute medium wave infrared radiation were much more flexible in their employment. The exhaust trail of a jet is ripe with high temperature byproducts, and the engine heat would saturate through the body of an aircraft and provide enough radiation to be detected. This gives a wide range of aspects and elevation in which sufficient heat could be detected - pretty much everything except staring right at the aircrafts nose.

Infrared tech is now going towards long wave radiation, where the skin friction of the air on the frame provides sufficient heat that can be detected. The biggest issue with this technology is the photons are quite a bit lower energy, and both internal thermal noise in the sensor and random fluctuations the atmosphere (foreground and background) contribute enough noise that the tracking problem becomes difficult. Not impossible, but difficult. At sufficient range, a target may only be a few pixels large, and if an errant photon from the horizon hits the sensor it could contribute enough energy to be about the same size of the target. Advanced filtering and other techniques are required to optimize how these sensors perform.

Historically they have been pretty simple, The first ones didn't track at all and just exploded when they got near something hotter than the empty sky, then the seeking ones were invented long before computers so they were just a rocket that had a ring of infrared sensors around the nose that would turn the rocket vaguely towards whatever was hottest. And they didn't really fly around chasing things as much as they would sort of vaguely auto correct a shot that went near a plane to a shot that hit the plane.

Now that computers are a thing and missiles cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, they do act more like cartoon missiles where they can fly around chasing things all over. The line between missile and drone gets smaller by the day.

This is incorrect. Missiles do not "chase things all over". No matter the guidance type, radar, IR, whatever. The issue is not with computer guiding it. The issue is with engine burn time, which for short range missiles can be as short as <10-15 seconds (even less with MANPADS, shoulder fired missiles can have as little as 3-5 seconds of engine burn time and they are often supersonic by that time. Example, russian 9K32 Strela-2 launch engine burn is 0.5 second to leave the tube, followed by sustainer flight motor additional 2 seconds, with top speed of 960mph by the time engine burns out. It will self-liquidate after 14-17 seconds to avoid collateral ground damage if it fails to intercept). The rest of the flight is ballistic trajectory with fins directing the flight, until it no longer has enough energy to stay airborne.

​

What missile does, it computes shorterst intercept route for your current trajectory and goes to the projected intersection point. Which is not really what is usually shown in a movie. It does not "chase" you, its not energy efficient enough. The less turns it has to do, the less energy it bleeds off (which is one of defeat modes, others being misdirecting it - in case of IR homing - with an IR dazzler/jammer, or flares. You dont "outmaneuver" it as it is, especially with its engine running it has way more g load / turn rate capability than your aircraft structure can withstand, not even talking about the pilot...)

I wouldn’t say the OP is incorrect completely. The missile type you’re speaking to, sure, but there’s a number of guidance systems and logic’s out there. The “chase” guidance does exist in a lot of the older and less efficient missiles. Usually referred to as “pure pursuit”.

You’re correct about the way pro-nav works on calculating a intercept point, however there’s dramatically more nuances to it based on the missile and guidance system. Some of which have the sustainability to continue maneuvering.

Disagree. "chase things all over" implies it'll turn around and re-engage.

Trajectory is roughly linear. It'll arch and steer, of course, but the rate of closure of weapons is >1 mach, often pushing up to almost 5 mach in some cases (altitude, size of interceptor, engagement geometry).

If a missile passes and doesn't intercept, it will not turn around. It's done. It's engine burned out a few seconds after launch and it's been coasting since. Turning around would take an arch with a radius measured in miles (high-gee maneuvers are a thing, but these are performed while engines are burning and delta-v is still available).

I'd not say "made up", its just a very, very common misconception (especially if you see a video showing missile - i.e, SA-7 MANPADS have that issue - snaking on the sky, as in waving left and right due to the way their sensor works). And true, missiles and drones are starting to have some common points nowadays, like drone flight planning software using similar algorythms. And first guided missiles did use analog electric systems instead of electronics, so "now that computers are a thing" is also correct.

​

Also, stated cost is not far off tbh for an unit price. Missiles cost A LOT (can go easily at 100-200 thousands USD per missile for a MANPADS unit, and larger/more potent systems go well into millions per missile...which is still way cheaper than its intended target), hence the rise of directed energy weapon (laser and/or microwave beam) projects, like THOR, THEL or HELLADS for anti-drone / anti-artillery rounds work for example.

The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum og where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called "error”.

This is the least ELI5 answer I’ve ever seen, but you have my respect for keeping that logic straight.

This is so old. I remember being sent this by email as an audio file by my uncle in the late 90s/early 00s. Does anyone actually know where it came from?

do pilots really say "Eagle 7, Fox 3" when firing?

The fox code is very useful to tell friendlies about the type of guidance system the missile has.

For example, Fox 1 being a semi-active homing system, the missile rides the radar of the firing aircraft all the way to the target. These have a low chance of hitting a friendly if you make sure to not lock them in the first place, and if a friendly gets locked by a Fox 3 at a similar time - active radar guidance, so the missile has its own radar it uses to guide itself to the target - then they know that it wasn’t a friendly’a missile or radar making their RWR go off and should take defensive action.

So yes

thanks - Independence Day was at least partly based on facts!

Yeah they do, but the Fox numbers are to identify which type of missile is firing, not which missile on the plane is firing (as seen in movies).

Eh, even the notoriously inaccurate Independence Day got it right as far as I can remember. They shot AMRAAMs with a Fox 3 call. Granted, I don't entirely get why they were using low-yield A2A missiles to take down the mothership, but the Fox call was right.

What's a movie where they get it wrong?

"Heat Seeking Missiles" is an antiquated term. These missiles were designed in the 70-80's to follow certain heat signatures given off by afterburners and destroy something above a certain temperature. This was when 8 bytes was a lot of experimental software with no direction or backing.

Movies make all of this look way more sophisticated than it is/was. Chaff wouldn't be an adequate deterrent if this was as smart as Bond films make it out to be.

Newer tech within 5th gen fighters and drones basically make this worthless for future air battles unless they can detect missiles from much further away than current abilities.

Chaff is an anti-radar countermeasure. I think you were going to say flares here. And correct - nowadays, against a modern missile like the AIM-9X, they are not as effective as against older systems.

The first operational heat-seeking missile was designed in the late 1940s and was operational by 1956 with combat introduction in 1958.

They don't just follow afterburner, while the first ones were sensitive enough to see engines of all types, later ones get sensitive enough that by the late 60s they can also home on the hot edges of fast moving fighters and bombers as leading edges and the noses get hot from friction.

Since the early 1990s, many heat-seeking missiles also can see into the UV spectrum as many flares don't kick out UV but exhaust plumes and reflected light do.

The advent of 5th generation fighters has not degraded the combat effectiveness of heat seekers as all 5th gen fighters have giant plumes of heat coming out of their engines.

From front and forward quarter aspects, a LO type has a smaller detection radius than older types, but from the rear or above, they are just as vulnerable

Heat seeking is just another way of saying IR guided missiles which are definitely not antiquated.

Interestingly, devices that could detect an airborne heat source were thought of in the run-up to WW2. R V Jones who later became well known for countering the German bombing "beams" was trying to build very sensitive IR detectors for that in the late 1930s. Unfortunately they weren't good enough to detect the heat of a piston engine exhaust at the range necessary for night-time bomber interception.

So not sure if this analogy works but. Let's say you're in the dark trying to find a friend. Say your friend shines a torchlight around you. You fix your eyes on the torchlight and walk towards the person until you reach him.

In this case, your eyes are the infrared sensor in the missile's nose and the torchlight is a heat source (and aircraft engine/afterburner). You/sensor lock onto the torch/heatsource and guide to the target.

Now that was just one heat source. In reality there are a lot more background sources of heat (the sun, heat decoys/flares countermeasures). Which can confuse you.

So if another friend wants to trick you into guiding to him in the dark. He just shines another torch which might make you walk to him instead.

Modern heat seekers like the Aim-9X/Python 5 are designed to be able to somewhat distinguish between decoys and the actual target heat source. Hope this helped!

Inside the nose of the missile is an infrared sensor. The sensor is covered by a spinning disc, which has a hole in it. As the disc spins, another sensor keeps track of the hole's location. When the disc spins, the hole spins with it, and when the infrared sensor detects a bright spot (heat) through the hole, the sensor which keeps track of the hole's position will tell the missile to turn in the direction the hole was facing.

So if you image the disc as a compass, and the hole is to the West (left) when it picks up a bright spot, the missile will turn to the left.

This may be the design on an older missile. I'm not sure. An engineer told me how they work several years ago, and I thought it was really interesting.
